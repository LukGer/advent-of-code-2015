# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) - a series of daily programming challenges throughout December.

Each day's challenge is organized in its own folder (e.g., `01/`, `02/`, etc.) containing:
- `a.ts` - Solution for part A
- `b.ts` - Solution for part B
- `input.txt` - Puzzle input
- `test.txt` - Test input (when applicable)

## Setup

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution, navigate to that day's folder and run the file:

```bash
cd 01
bun run a.ts  # for part A
bun run b.ts  # for part B
```

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.com) as the JavaScript runtime.
